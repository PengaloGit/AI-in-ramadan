# AI in Ramadan

Welcome to the **AI in Ramadan** repository! This project contains the source code and resources used in my muti-session presentation, **"AI in Ramadan."**
This presentation is structured as a step-by-step series of concise introductions to the fundamentals of artificial intelligence, making complex topics accessible for beginners

## Overview

This repository includes:

- **Source Code:** Examples and demos showcasing AI techniques and applications.
- **Presentation Materials:** Slides, diagrams, and notes used during the presentation.
  
## Structure

This repository will be divided into session folders, with each folder containing the presentation and the Jupyter notebook.

## Prerequisites

Since the code is in the jupyter format, I remend running it on collab.

However if your interesseted by running the code locally, 
you may need to add the dependencies that are not present in the notebook since collab has them by default!!.
